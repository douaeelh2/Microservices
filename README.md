# 1. Introduction to Microservices

# What are Microservices?

- Microservices are a software architectural style in which a large application is built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network.

- Each service is a self-contained unit of functionality that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently of the other services. This allows for more flexibility and scalability than a monolithic architecture, where all the functionality is contained in a single, large codebase.

- Microservices can be written in different programming languages and use different technologies as long as they can communicate with each other through a common API.

- Microservices are designed to be loosely coupled, meaning that changes to one service should not affect the other services. This makes it easier to update, maintain, and scale the application. Microservices architecture is best suited for large and complex applications that need to handle a high volume of traffic and be scaled horizontally.
